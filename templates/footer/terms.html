				<h3>Terms</h3>
		<p>Yupeat, INC.</p>
		<h3>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
		<p>By using this site (the "Site"), you ("you" or the "End User") agree to the terms and conditions that we ("Yupeat") have provided. If you do not wish to agree to these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use" or "Agreement"), please refrain from using the Site.</p>
		<h3>I.TERMS OF USE</h3>
		<b>1. General.</b>
		<p>The Site provides an interactive online service operated by Yupeat, Inc. on the World Wide Web of the Internet (the "Web"), consisting of information services, content and transaction capabilities facilitated through Yupeat, affiliates of Yupeat or merchants ("Merchants") offering a service for the purchase of goods at Merchants and other third parties.</p>
		<p>This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to the use of this Site by the End User. By using this Site (other than to read this Agreement for the first time), End User agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. The right to use this Site is personal to End User and is not transferable to any other person or entity. End User shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of End Userís password(s), if any. End User acknowledges that, although the Internet is often a secure environment, sometimes there are interruptions in service or events that are beyond the control of Yupeat, and Yupeat shall not be responsible for any data lost while transmitting information on the Internet. While it is Yupeatís objective is to make the Site accessible 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the Site may be unavailable from time to time for any reason including, without limitation, routine maintenance. You understand and acknowledge that due to circumstances both within and outside of the control of Yupeat, access to the Site may be interrupted, suspended or terminated from time to time.</p>
		<p>Yupeat shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Site, including, but not limited to, content, hours of availability and equipment needed for access or use. Further, Yupeat may discontinue disseminating any portion of information or category of information, may change or eliminate any transmission method and may change transmission speeds or other signal characteristics.</p>
		<p>You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to use the Site. However, if you are at least 13 years old but not yet 18, you may use the Site in conjunction with your parent or guardian who agrees to this Agreement. No one under age 13 may use the Site.</p>
		<b>2. Modified Terms.</b>
		<p>Yupeat reserves the right at all times to discontinue or modify any of our Terms of Use and/or our Privacy Policy as we deem necessary or desirable. Such changes may include, among other things, the adding of certain fees or charges. If Yupeat makes any substantial changes, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address that is registered with your account and/or by posting notice of the change on the Site. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be effective upon the earlier of our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our Site, provided that these changes will not apply to Vouchers purchased prior to the effective date of such changes. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site and any Vouchers purchased by such new users. We suggest to you, therefore, that you re-read this important notice containing our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy from time to time in order that you stay informed as to any such changes. Any use of the Site by End User after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by End User of such modifications.</p>
<b>3. Equipment.</b>
		<p>End User shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telephone, computer hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of this Site and all charges related thereto. Yupeat shall not be liable for any damages to the End Userís equipment resulting from the use of this Site.</p>
		<b>4. End User Conduct.</b>
		<p>This Site and any individual sites or merchant-specific, city-specific, or state-specific sites now or hereinafter contained within or otherwise available through external hyperlinks with our Site (the "Microsites") are private property. All interactions on this Site and/or the Microsites must comply with these Terms of Use. Although we welcome and encourage user interaction on our Site, we do insist and require that all end users restrict any and all activity in connection with the use of this Site and the Microsites to that which involves lawful purposes only. End User shall not post or transmit through this Site any material which violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others, or any material which is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any law, or which, without Yupeatís express prior, written approval, contains advertising or any solicitation with respect to products or services. Any conduct by an End User that in Yupeatís exclusive discretion restricts or inhibits any other End User from using or enjoying this Site and/or any of the Microsites is strictly prohibited. End User shall not use this Site or any of the Microsites to advertise or perform any commercial, religious, political or non-commercial solicitation, including, but not limited to, the solicitation of users of this Site and/or the Microsites to become users of other on- or offline services directly or indirectly competitive or potentially competitive with Yupeat.</p>
		<p>The foregoing provisions of this Section 4 apply equally to and are for the benefit of Yupeat, its subsidiaries, affiliates, Merchants and its third-party content providers and licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.</p>
		<b>5. Copyright and Trademarks.</b>
		<p>End User shall not upload, post or otherwise make available on this Site any material protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of the copyright, trademark or other proprietary right. Yupeat does not have any express burden or responsibility to provide End User with indications, markings or anything else that may aid End User in determining whether the material in question is copyrighted or trademarked. End User shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, trademarks, proprietary rights or any other harm resulting from such a submission. By submitting material to any public area of this Site or any Microsite, End User warrants that the owner of such material has expressly granted Yupeat the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute such material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such material. End User also permits any other end user to access, view, store or reproduce the material for that End Userís personal use. End User hereby grants Yupeat the right to edit, copy, publish and distribute any material made available on this Site or any Microsite by End User.</p>
		<p>The foregoing provisions of Section 5 apply equally to and are for the benefit of Yupeat, its subsidiaries, affiliates, Merchants and its third party content providers and licensors and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.</p>
		<p>Yupeat reserves the right to terminate its agreement with any End User who repeatedly infringes third-party copyright rights upon prompt notification to Yupeat by the copyright owner or the copyright ownerís legal agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that a copyrighted work has been copied and posted via the Site or any Microsite in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you shall provide Yupeat with the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyrighted work; (b) an identification and location on the Site or any Microsite of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (c) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law; (d) your name and contact information, such as telephone number or e-mail address; and (e) a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright ownerís behalf. Contact information for Yupeatís Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement is as follows:</p>
		<ul><li>Yupeat, Inc.</li><li>Att:DMCA/Copyright Agent</li><li>yupeat@yupeat.com</li></ul>
		<b>7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</b>
		<p>END USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THIS SITE AND THE MICROSITES IS AT END USERíS SOLE RISK. NEITHER Yupeat, ITS AFFILIATES NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, MERCHANTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS, OR ANY OF THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, WARRANT THAT USE OF THE SITE OR ANY MICROSITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO (I) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THIS SITE, OR ANY MICROSITE, OR (II) THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE OR VOUCHERS PROVIDED THROUGH THIS SITE OR THE MICROSITES.</p>
		<p>THIS SITE AND THE MICROSITES ARE MADE ACCESSIBLE ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. Yupeat HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE OF TITLE NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
		<b>8. Limitation of Liability.</b>
		<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL Yupeat, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL YupeatíS LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH A Yupeat EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID FOR SUCH Yupeat, AND TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY END USER DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRECEDING THE BRINGING OF ANY CLAIM.</p>
		<b>9. Monitoring.</b>
		<p>Yupeat shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of the Site and any Microsites at all times, including any chat rooms and forums that may hereinafter be included as part of the Site, to determine compliance with this Agreement and any operating rules established by Yupeat, as well as to satisfy any applicable law, regulation or authorized government request. Without limiting the foregoing, Yupeat shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove any material that Yupeat, in its sole discretion, finds to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable.</p>
		<b>10. Privacy.</b>
		<p>End User acknowledges that all discussion for ratings, comments, bulletin board service, chat rooms and/or other message or communication facilities (collectively "Communities") are public and not private communications, and that, therefore, others may read End Userís communications without End Userís knowledge. Yupeat does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Community, and, therefore, Yupeat specifically disclaims any liability concerning the Communities and any actions resulting from End Usersí participation in any Community, including any objectionable content. Generally, any communication which End User posts to Yupeat (whether in chat rooms, discussion groups, message boards or otherwise) is considered to be non-confidential. If particular web pages permit the submission of communications that will be treated by Yupeat as confidential, that fact will be stated on those pages. By posting comments, messages or other information on the Site or any Microsite, End User grants Yupeat the right to use such comments, messages or information for promotions, advertising, market research or any other lawful purpose without territorial, time or other limitation. For more information see Yupeatís Privacy Policy.</p>
		<b>11. License Grant.</b>
		<p>By posting communications on or through this Site or any Microsite, End User shall be deemed to have granted to Yupeat a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the communication alone or as part of other works in any form, media, or technology whether now known or hereafter developed without territorial or time limitations, and to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees.</p>
		<b>12. Indemnification/Release.</b>
		<p>End User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Yupeat, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneysí fees, arising out of or related to any products or services purchased by End User in connection with the Site or any Microsites.</p>
		<p>End User is solely responsible for interactions with Merchants and other users of the Site or Microsites. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, End User hereby releases Yupeat from any and all claims or liability related to any product or service of a Merchant, any action or in-action by Merchant, including Merchantís failure to comply with applicable law and/or failure to abide by the terms of a Voucher, and any conduct or speech, whether online or offline, of any other user.</p>
		<p>In connection with the foregoing release, End User hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542 (and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction) which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
		<b>13. Termination.</b>
		<p>Yupeat may terminate this Agreement at any time. Without limiting the foregoing, Yupeat shall have the right to immediately terminate or suspend any passwords or accounts of End User in the event of any conduct by End User or which Yupeat, in its sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by End User of this Agreement. The provisions of Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12 will survive termination of this Agreement."</p>
		<b>14. Trademarks.</b>
		<p>Yupeat is a trademark of Yupeat, Inc. All rights in respect of this trademark are hereby expressly reserved. Unless otherwise indicated, all other trademarks appearing on Yupeat are the property of their respective owners.</p>
		<b>15. Third-Party Content.</b>
		<p>Yupeat, similar to an Internet Service Provider, is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by third parties and End Users. Accordingly, Yupeat has no more editorial control over such content than does a public library, bookstore or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers, or any other end users are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of Yupeat.</p>
		<p>In many instances, the content available through this Site represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, end user, or other user not under contract with Yupeat. Yupeat neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made on Yupeat by anyone other than authorized Yupeat employee spokespersons while acting in official capacities. Under no circumstances will Yupeat be liable for any loss or damage caused by an end userís reliance on information obtained through Yupeat. It is the responsibility of End User to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice, etc., or other content available through Yupeat.</p>
		<p>Yupeat contains links to third-party websites maintained by other content providers. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Yupeat of the contents on such third-party sites, and Yupeat hereby expressly disclaims any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party websites. If End User decides to access linked third-party websites, End User does so at its own risk. Unless you have executed a written agreement with Yupeat expressly permitting you to do so, you may not provide a hyperlink to the Site or any Microsite from any other website. Yupeat reserves the right to revoke its consent to any link at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
		<b>16. Miscellaneous.</b>
		<p>This Agreement, including the Terms of Sale set forth below (which are incorporated into this Agreement), and any operating rules for Yupeat established by Yupeat, constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall be of no legal force or effect. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in this Agreement, and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of either party to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or any other rights provided hereunder.</p>
		<b>17. Arbitration.</b>
		<p>By using this Site, End User agrees that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy End User may have against Yupeat arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement, this Site, or any Microsite, or the purchase or sale of any Voucher(s), shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA ("Rules and Procedures"); (2) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for End User), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by End User and Yupeat; (3) the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (4) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the End Userís and/or Yupeatís individual claims; and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (5) in the event that the End User is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Yupeat will pay as much of the End Userís filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (6) with the exception of subpart (4) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (4) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither End User nor Yupeat shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on AAA and its Rules and Procedures, End Users may visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.</p>
		<b>18. Disclosures.</b>
		<p>For Florida residents purchasing Vouchers where the Merchant is a healthcare provider: The patient and any other person responsible for payment has a right to refuse to pay, cancel payment or be reimbursed for payment for any service, examination or treatment that is performed as a result of and within 72 hours of responding to the advertisement for the free, discounted fee or reduced fee service, examination or treatment. In most states, businesses not exclusively owned by physicians are prohibited from practicing medicine.</p>
		<p>If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210. You should note that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Current providers of such protections can be found at: http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Content_Control_Software.</p>
