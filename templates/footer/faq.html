		  	  <h3>FAQ</h3>
			  
			  <div class="q_and_a">
			  	<p class="question">
			  		Where is Yupeat service being offered?
			  	</p>
				<p class="answer">
					<u>San Francisco</u><br/><br/>
					Safeway, 298 King St, San Francisco<br/>
					Safeway (Market St.), 2020 Market St, San Francisco<br/>
					Whole Foods, 1765 California St, San Francisco <br/><br/>
					
					We fully intend to continue to grow to other neighborhoods in San Francisco 
					based on what we hear from our users.  
				</p>
				
				<p class="question">
			  		What do I get with a Yupeat subscription?
			  	</p>
				<p class="answer">
					Yupeat subscribers can place an order on any day of the work week (M-F, excluding standard holidays)
					and have our buyers purchase ingredients for that day's meal which you receive via email
					during your workday. The ingredients are available for pickup anytime between 5-7p and 
					users can place an order anytime up until 4:30p. 
					<br/><br/>
					The idea is to make fresh and delcious meal ingredients available to you when you're most busy. 
					Users only pay for the groceries they purchase.   
				</p>
				
				<p class="question">
			  		What types of meal ideas should I expect?
			  	</p>
				<p class="answer">
					Below are a few examples:
					<ul>
						<li>Baked Teriyaki Chicken with Bacon and Kimchi Fried Rice</li>
						<li>Pork Chops with Black-Bean and Tomato Quinoa</li>
						<li>Bourbon Chicken on Rice with Sauteed Cauliflower</li>
						<li>Italian Turkey Sausage and Tomatoes over Rotini Pasta</li>
					</ul>   
				</p>
				
				<p class="question">
			  		How do you set meal ingredient prices?
			  	</p>
				<p class="answer">
					Generally a Yupeat buyer purchases ingredients for the next day's recipe in 
					advance. Every effort is made to have the prices on the website match the store's
					price. We don't mark-up the price of ingredients. <br/><br/>
					
					In the case of meat which varies between packages, we aim to be within $1 (above or below)
					of what appears on the website.
