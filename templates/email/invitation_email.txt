More on how it works:
1. Once per day you receive an email with a dinner meal recipe.
2. If you dig it, review the list of ingredients to deselect items you already have at home.
3. Place an order any time before 4:30p and pick-up any time between 5-7p curbside, directly in front of the {{store.store_name}} at {{store.street1}}, in front of the CalTrain station.

If you have questions or feedback feel free to contact us at support@yupeat.com.
We'll see you soon. Thanks!
