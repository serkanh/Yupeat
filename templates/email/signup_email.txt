WooHoo! Welcome to Yupeat. Soon you'll begin receiving one email per day with a description 
of a meal and the ingredients that you can order using our service. 

Here's how it works:

1. Once per day you receive an email with a meal idea.

2. If you dig it, review the list of ingredients to deselect items you already have at home.

3. Place an order anytime before 4:30p and pick-up between 5-7p curbside, 
directly in front of the {{store.store_name}} on {{store.street1}}.

If you have questions or feedback feel free to contact us at support@yupeat.com.
We'll see you soon. Thanks!

Ray + The Yupeat Team
